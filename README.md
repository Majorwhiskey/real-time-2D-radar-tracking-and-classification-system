# real-time-2D-radar-tracking-and-classification-system
This project implements 2D radar target tracking using a Kalman Filter. It simulates noisy measurements and estimates position and velocity of a moving object, visualizing true, noisy, and estimated trajectories. Ideal for beginners in radar tracking and state estimation using Python.
